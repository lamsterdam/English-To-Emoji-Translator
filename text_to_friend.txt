  Dude! I'm so angry I'm flipping out!
  I don't know if I should laugh or be crying right now.
  I'm disgusted that the ping-pong team didn't leave me even ONE slice of pizza!
  The captain is so evil and heartless. They don't have a heart as far as I can tell.
  They knew my cat was sick and I wouldn't be at the tournament until late.
  I'm surprised they acted innocent when I confronted them.
  They lost the game without me... guess who will be rotfl when I'm at the next
  tournament and we win!
 
  Dang. I sure hope Prof. Bagley brings some munchies to class today. I'm starving.
